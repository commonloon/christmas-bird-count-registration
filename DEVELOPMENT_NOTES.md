## CURRENT STATE

### Working Features
1. **Public Registration**: Form with interactive map, email validation, leadership interest tracking
2. **Admin Authentication**: Google OAuth with email whitelist working properly

## TECHNICAL CONTEXT

### Key Implementation Details
- **Database**: Google Firestore with year-based collections
- **Authentication**: Google Identity Services (not redirect flow) with Secret Manager credentials
- **Deployment**: Google Cloud Run in us-west1 region
- **Business Logic**: Auto-assignment when leaders register, one-area-per-leader rule enforcement
- **Maps**: Two separate Leaflet.js implementations with live refresh capability
  - Registration map: Area selection for participants
  - Leaders map: Real-time leadership status with client-side data management
- **Frontend Architecture**: Bootstrap 5 + Bootstrap Icons + Leaflet.js with AJAX operations
- **Data Synchronization**: Client-side `window.leaderData` management for instant UI updates

### Critical Files Structure
```
routes/
  admin.py           # Complete admin interface with inline edit/delete functionality
    - edit_leader: JSON API for inline editing with validation
    - delete_leader: JSON API for leader deletion with participant sync
    - add_leader: Manual leader entry (fixed dictionary access bugs)
  api.py            # JSON endpoints for map data caching
  
static/js/
  map.js            # Registration page interactive map
  leaders-map.js    # Leaders page map with live refresh and client-side data management
    - window.refreshLeadersMap(): Main refresh function
    - clearMapLayers(): Remove existing polygons for redraw
    - calculateAreasNeedingLeaders(): Client-side leadership calculation
  
templates/admin/
  leaders.html      # Inline editing interface with dual display/edit modes
    - Bootstrap Icons for edit/delete buttons
    - AJAX operations with window.leaderData synchronization
  
templates/base.html # Bootstrap Icons CDN integration

models/
  area_leader.py    # Business rule enforcement and validation
  participant.py    # Enhanced with get_participants_by_email() for sync
```

### Recent Bug Fixes Applied
1. **Dictionary Access Errors**: Fixed add_leader route treating dictionaries as objects
   - Changed `leader.leader_email` → `leader['leader_email']`
   - Changed `leader_areas[0].area_code` → `leader_areas[0]['area_code']`
2. **Template Name Field Population**: Fixed edit button clearing first/last name fields
   - Added intelligent handling of both `first_name`/`last_name` and `leader_name` data structures
   - Template now splits combined names when separate fields are unavailable
3. **Template Logic**: Fixed area dropdown rendering to use actual area data structure
4. **Backend Validation**: Added missing required field validation and area code validation
5. **Error Handling**: Proper logging and user feedback for all error conditions
6. **Data Consistency**: Enhanced business rule enforcement preventing duplicate assignments

## OAUTH SETUP STATUS ✅
- Google OAuth client configured and working
- Published consent screen (not in testing mode)  
- Credentials stored in Google Secret Manager

- Admin authentication fully functional

## DEVELOPMENT STATUS
The application has core functionality implemented:
- ✅ Public registration with map-based area selection
- ✅ Admin authentication and interface
- ✅ Leader management with interactive map
- ✅ Year-based data architecture
- ✅ Enhanced user experience and validation

**Still in active development** - additional testing and refinement needed before deployment.
