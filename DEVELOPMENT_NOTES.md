# DEVELOPMENT NOTES - Christmas Bird Count Registration App

## COMPLETED TASKS (Most Recent Session)

### Admin Interface Implementation ✅
- **Security Fix**: Removed public admin link from base template 
- **OAuth Authentication**: Fixed Google Identity Services integration with proper client configuration

  - Dashboard with statistics and year selector
  - Participant management with delete functionality 
  - Unassigned participant assignment tools

### Leader Management System ✅ 
- **Business Rules Implemented**:
