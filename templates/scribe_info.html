                    <p>One way to help out on count day is to act as a scribe, partnering with a more expert birder to record the list of species that they identify. The scribe role is perfect if you're newer to birding and want to participate without the pressure of accurately identifying birds yourself. Scribes who can use eBird are especially valuable.</p>

                    <h3 class="text-primary mt-4">Preparation</h3>
                    <p>If you aren't familiar with eBird, we strongly recommend that you take the free online <a href="https://academy.allaboutbirds.org/product/ebird-essentials/" target="_blank" class="text-decoration-none">eBird Essentials class</a> to learn the basics. After completing the class, please download the app and practice using it in the field before Count Day.</p>

                        <strong>New for this year:</strong> "Scribe" is a new support role that we're piloting for this year's Vancouver Christmas Bird Count. Not all Area Leaders may need a scribe, but we'll let them know that you are interested in helping out by being a scribe.
