# Christmas Bird Count Registration System

A web-based registration system for Christmas Bird Count events with interactive map-based area selection, admin management tools, and automated team notifications.

Originally developed for Nature Vancouver's annual Christmas Bird Count, this system is designed to be portable and adaptable for other bird count clubs.
## <h1 style="color: red;">CAUTION</h1>
<em style="color: red;">All original code and much of the documentation was generated by Claude.ai in response to prompts from Harvey Dueck.

Like every AI I've tried, Claude is prone to making exaggerated claims, stating that a test suite for a single feature
is "comprehensive", that some very sloppy code is "professional", or that something is "production ready" when it hasn't 
been tested yet.  Don't trust such value judgements in documentation
or code comments.  As of 10.10.2025 when I'm checking this in, I haven't yet had time to carefully review the documentation.
It's included in the hope that it will be useful, even if it's incomplete and occasionally inaccurate.

## Features

- **Interactive Map Registration**: Participants select count areas by clicking on an interactive map or using dropdown menus
- **Not Mobile-unfriendly**: Allows for registration via smartphones and tablets.  Admin works better on a desktop.
- **Admin Management**: Dashboard for coordinators to manage participants, assign area leaders, and export data
- **Area Leader Tools**: Interface for area leaders to view their team
- **Automated Notifications**: Email updates to leaders when team composition changes
- **Historical Data Access**: View past years' participant data for recruitment and planning
- **Multi-Environment Support**: Separate test and production deployments with isolated databases

## Technology Stack

- **Backend**: Python/Flask with Google Cloud Run
- **Database**: Google Firestore (serverless NoSQL)
- **Authentication**: Google OAuth with role-based access control
- **Frontend**: Bootstrap 5 + Leaflet.js for interactive mapping
- **Email**: Scheduled emails sent via SMTP

## Quick Links by Role

### For Participants

Registration is simple and straightforward - just visit your club's registration URL and follow the on-screen instructions. Select your preferred count area using the interactive map or dropdown menu.

### For Area Leaders

If you've been designated as an area leader, you can access your team roster and historical participant data through the leader interface.

**Documentation:**
- [**Area Leader Guide**](docs/LEADER_GUIDE.md) - How to use the leader interface and manage your team

### For Count Administrators

Admins can manage participant registrations, assign area leaders, handle unassigned participants, and export data for planning.

**Documentation:**
- [**Admin Guide**](docs/ADMIN_GUIDE.md) - Using the admin dashboard and management tools
- [**Deployment Guide**](docs/DEPLOYMENT.md) - How to deploy and configure the system for your club

### For Developers

Developers can contribute to the project or customize it for specific club needs.

**Documentation:**
- [**Developer Guide**](docs/DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md) - Getting started with development
- [**Technical Specification**](docs/SPECIFICATION.md) - Complete system architecture and implementation details
- [**Testing Guide**](docs/TESTING.md) - Running the test suite

## Setup and Deployment

This system is designed to be deployed by other Christmas Bird Count clubs with minimal configuration changes. All organization-specific settings are centralized in configuration files.

**Key Setup Documents:**
- [**Deployment Guide**](docs/DEPLOYMENT.md) - Complete deployment instructions for Google Cloud Run
- [**Google Cloud Setup**](docs/GCLOUD-SETUP.md) - Initial Google Cloud project configuration
- [**OAuth Setup**](docs/OAUTH-SETUP.md) - Authentication configuration
- [**Email System**](docs/EMAIL_SPEC.md) - Email notification setup

**Requirements:**
- Google Cloud account
- Custom domain with DNS access
- Google Workspace or compatible OAuth provider
- SMTP email provider (for notifications)

**Cost**: Typical operating costs are $5-15/month for small to medium-sized counts using Google Cloud's scale-to-zero serverless infrastructure.

## Customization for Your Club

To adapt this system for your bird count:

1. **Update Configuration Files**:
   - `config/organization.py` - Club name, contact emails, timezone
   - `config/areas.py` - Your count area codes and names
   - `config/admins.py` - Admin email addresses
   - `static/data/area_boundaries.json` - Geographic boundaries (GeoJSON)

2. **Deploy to Google Cloud**:
   - Follow the [Deployment Guide](docs/DEPLOYMENT.md)
   - Configure custom domains
   - Set up OAuth authentication

3. **Test and Launch**:
   - Test environment deployment first
   - Verify all features work with your configuration
   - Deploy to production when ready

**No code changes should be required** - the system is designed to be configuration-driven.
