## Annual Season Start

**When to do this**: At the beginning of each registration season (typically October/November)

**What you need**:
- Access to a computer with command line
- Google Cloud login credentials
- 15 minutes

**Steps:**

### 1. Verify Database Indexes

Database indexes ensure the registration system runs quickly. Each year, new collections are created automatically, and indexes must be set up for these collections.

```bash
# Make sure you're logged in to Google Cloud
gcloud auth login

# Run the index verification script for the test environment
python utils/verify_indexes.py <TEST-DATABASE>  # Example: my-club-test

# If test looks good, run for production
python utils/verify_indexes.py <PROD-DATABASE>  # Example: my-club-register
```

**What you'll see:**
- The script checks if this year's collections exist
- If collections don't exist yet, you'll be prompted to register yourself first
- The script will create any missing indexes automatically
- Index creation takes a few minutes (happens in the background)

**Expected output:**
```
[OK] participants_2025 exists
[OK] removal_log_2025 exists
[OK] Identity-based queries
[NEW] New indexes created: 5
SUCCESS: All indexes are ready!
```

### 2. Test the Registration Form

Visit your test site and register yourself:
- **Test site**: `https://<TEST-DOMAIN>`  (Example: `https://cbc-test.myclub.org`)
- Fill out the registration form
- Verify you receive a confirmation
- Check that you appear in the admin interface

### 3. Update Admin Accounts (if needed)

If your coordinators have changed, update the admin list:

1. Edit `config/admins.py`
2. Update the `PRODUCTION_ADMIN_EMAILS` list
3. Deploy the updated code (see [Deploying Updates](#deploying-updates))

### 4. Deploy to Production

Once testing is complete:

```bash
# Deploy to production
./deploy.sh production
```

Wait 2-3 minutes for deployment to complete, then test the production registration form.

### 5. Share Registration URL

Send participants to:
- **Production**: `https://<PROD-DOMAIN>`  (Example: `https://cbc-registration.myclub.org`)

---

## Deploying Updates

**When to do this**: When you need to deploy code changes or configuration updates

```bash
# Deploy to test environment (always test first!)
./deploy.sh test

# After testing, deploy to production
./deploy.sh production

# Or deploy to both at once
./deploy.sh both
```

**Deployment takes 2-3 minutes**. You'll see build progress and a success message with the service URL.

---

## Common Tasks

### Viewing Application Logs

If you need to troubleshoot issues:

```bash
# View recent logs (test)
gcloud run services logs read <TEST-SERVICE> --region=us-west1 --limit=50

# View recent logs (production)
gcloud run services logs read <PROD-SERVICE> --region=us-west1 --limit=50

# Watch logs in real-time (test)
gcloud run services logs tail <TEST-SERVICE> --region=us-west1
```

### Checking Service Status

```bash
# Check test service
gcloud run services describe <TEST-SERVICE> --region=us-west1

# Check production service
gcloud run services describe <PROD-SERVICE> --region=us-west1
```

### Exporting Participant Data

Use the admin interface at `/admin` to export CSV files of:
- All participants
- Area leaders
- Participants by area

---

## Initial Setup (First Time Only)

**When to do this**: Only when deploying the system for the first time

**What you need**:
- Google Cloud account with billing enabled
- Domain name for your organization
- 2-3 hours for complete setup

> [!CAUTION]
> The macOS and Linux instructions were generated by Claude.ai and are completely untested. 
> Development and testing were done on Windows.
> 
### 1. Install Google Cloud CLI

#### Windows
1. Download from https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install
2. Run the installer
3. Restart PowerShell

#### macOS
```bash
brew install google-cloud-sdk
```

#### Linux (Ubuntu/Debian)
```bash
echo "deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/cloud.google.gpg] https://packages.cloud.google.com/apt cloud-sdk main" | sudo tee -a /etc/apt/sources.list.d/google-cloud-sdk.list
curl https://packages.cloud.google.com/apt/doc/apt-key.gpg | sudo apt-key --keyring /usr/share/keyrings/cloud.google.gpg add -
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install google-cloud-cli
```

### 2. Authenticate with Google Cloud

```bash
# Log in to Google Cloud
gcloud auth login
```

### 3. Create Your Google Cloud Project

You need to create a new project for your bird count registration system.

#### Using Google Cloud Console (Recommended for beginners)

1. Go to https://console.cloud.google.com
2. Click the project dropdown at the top (or "Select a project")
3. Click "New Project"
4. Enter project details:
   - **Project name**: A descriptive name (e.g., "My Club CBC Registration")
   - **Project ID**: A unique identifier (e.g., `my-club-cbc-registration`)
     - This ID must be globally unique across all Google Cloud
     - Use lowercase letters, numbers, and hyphens only
     - Cannot be changed after creation
   - **Organization/Billing**: Select your billing account
5. Click "Create"
6. Wait for the project to be created (takes a few seconds)



### 4. Set Your Active Project

```bash
# Set your project ID (use the Project ID from step 3)
gcloud config set project <YOUR-PROJECT-ID>  # Example: my-club-cbc-registration

# Verify the configuration
gcloud config list
```

You should see output showing your project ID and account.

**Update Application Default Credentials:**

If you see a warning about quota project mismatch, update your Application Default Credentials:

```bash
# Update ADC quota project to match your active project
gcloud auth application-default set-quota-project <YOUR-PROJECT-ID>
```

This ensures that local development tools (like the database setup scripts) use the correct project for billing and quotas.

### 5. Enable Required Services
Enable services for the current google cloud project:
```bash
gcloud services enable run.googleapis.com
gcloud services enable firestore.googleapis.com
gcloud services enable cloudbuild.googleapis.com
gcloud services enable secretmanager.googleapis.com
gcloud services enable cloudscheduler.googleapis.com
```

### 6. Configure Your Organization

Edit `config/organization.py` with your club's details:
- Organization name
- Contact emails
- Domain names
- Timezone

See [DEPLOYMENT_TECHNICAL_REFERENCE.md](DEPLOYMENT_TECHNICAL_REFERENCE.md) for detailed configuration instructions.

### 7. Create Firestore Databases

```bash
# Install Python dependencies
pip install -r utils/requirements.txt

# Create databases (names configured in config/database.py)
python utils/setup_databases.py
```

This creates two databases with names you configured (e.g., `my-club-test` and `my-club-register`).

### 8. Set Up SMTP2GO Email Secrets

**IMPORTANT:** This step must be completed before OAuth setup and deployment.

The application uses SMTP2GO for sending email notifications to area leaders and participants.

```bash
# Run the SMTP secrets setup script
./utils/setup_smtp_secrets.sh
```

The script will prompt you for:
- SMTP2GO username
- SMTP2GO password (entered securely, not displayed)

**To get SMTP2GO credentials:**
1. Sign up for a free account at https://www.smtp2go.com
2. Verify your sending domain
3. Get your SMTP username and password from the SMTP2GO dashboard

**Notes:**
- If you don't have SMTP2GO credentials yet, you can use placeholder values for initial testing
- Email functionality won't work until real credentials are configured
- The system currently supports SMTP2GO only (other providers can be added in future)

### 9. Set Up OAuth Authentication

OAuth allows admins and area leaders to log in with Google accounts.

**IMPORTANT:** SMTP secrets (step 8) must be created before proceeding with OAuth setup and deployment.

**Detailed instructions**: See [OAUTH-SETUP.md](OAUTH-SETUP.md)

**Quick steps:**
1. Create OAuth client in Google Cloud Console
2. Download `client_secret.json`
3. Run `./utils/setup_oauth_secrets.sh`
4. Delete `client_secret.json`
5. Deploy application (Step 10)
6. Publish OAuth consent screen

### 10. Configure Admin Accounts

Edit `config/admins.py` and add admin email addresses:

```python
PRODUCTION_ADMIN_EMAILS = [
    'admin@myclub.org',         # Replace with your admin emails
    'coordinator@myclub.org'
]
```

### 11. Initial Deployment

```bash
# Deploy to test first
./deploy.sh test

# Test thoroughly, then deploy to production
./deploy.sh production
```

### 12. Configure Custom Domains

**Map domains using Google Cloud Console:**

1. Go to [Cloud Run Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/run)
2. Click on your **test service** (configured in `config/cloud.py`)
3. Click the **"MANAGE CUSTOM DOMAINS"** tab at the top
4. Click **"ADD MAPPING"**
5. Select your service from the dropdown
6. Enter your test domain (from `config/cloud.py`)
7. Click **"CONTINUE"**
8. Follow DNS verification instructions (add CNAME record shown)
9. Click **"DONE"**

Repeat for your **production service** with the production domain.

**Example DNS CNAME records** (add to your domain provider):
```
Name: cbc-test             # Or your test subdomain
Type: CNAME
Value: ghs.googlehosted.com

Name: cbc-registration     # Or your production subdomain
Type: CNAME
Value: ghs.googlehosted.com
```

**Notes:**
- Domain names are configured in `config/cloud.py`
- SSL certificates are automatically provisioned (takes up to 24 hours)
- You must have control of the DNS for your domain

### 13. Configure Email Scheduler (Optional)

For automated email notifications to area leaders:

```bash
# Create service account (one time)
gcloud iam service-accounts create cloud-scheduler-invoker \
    --display-name="Cloud Scheduler Email Invoker"

# Grant permissions to test service
gcloud run services add-iam-policy-binding <TEST-SERVICE> \
    --region=us-west1 \
    --member="serviceAccount:cloud-scheduler-invoker@<YOUR-PROJECT-ID>.iam.gserviceaccount.com" \
    --role="roles/run.invoker"

# Grant permissions to production service
gcloud run services add-iam-policy-binding <PROD-SERVICE> \
    --region=us-west1 \
    --member="serviceAccount:cloud-scheduler-invoker@<YOUR-PROJECT-ID>.iam.gserviceaccount.com" \
    --role="roles/run.invoker"

# Create scheduler jobs
./utils/setup_email_scheduler.sh test
./utils/setup_email_scheduler.sh production
```

### 14. Validate Installation

After completing initial setup, validate your configuration and infrastructure:

```bash
# Run all installation validation tests (37 tests)
pytest tests/installation/ -v

# Or run phases separately:
# Phase 1: Configuration only (21 tests, no GCP required)
pytest tests/installation/test_configuration.py -v

# Phase 2: Infrastructure (16 tests, requires GCP auth)
pytest tests/installation/test_infrastructure.py -v
```

**Expected result**: All 37 tests should pass.

**Phase 1 validates:**
- Configuration files in `config/`
- Area code consistency
- Email and URL formats
- Map configuration

**Phase 2 validates:**
- Firestore database access
- Secret Manager secrets exist
- Cloud Run services deployed
- Database indexes ready

**If tests fail**: Error messages will guide you to fix issues. Common problems include:
- Missing or misconfigured files in `config/`
- Area code mismatches between files
- Missing OAuth or SMTP secrets
- Services not deployed

**For detailed documentation**, see the [Installation Validation Tests](TESTING.md#installation-validation-tests) section in TESTING.md.

## Maintenance Tips

### During Registration Season

1. **Monitor daily**: Check logs for errors
2. **Export regularly**: Download participant lists weekly
3. **Test changes**: Always deploy to test environment first
4. **Back up data**: Firestore backs up automatically (see [BACKUPS.md](BACKUPS.md))

### Off-Season

1. **Keep services running**: Data persists year-to-year
2. **Cloud Run scales to zero**: Minimal costs during low-traffic periods
3. **Review billing**: Monitor at https://console.cloud.google.com/billing

### Before Next Season

1. **Run annual season start procedure** (see top of this document)
2. **Update admin accounts** if coordinators changed
3. **Test thoroughly** before opening registration
4. **Review and update count areas** if boundaries changed
