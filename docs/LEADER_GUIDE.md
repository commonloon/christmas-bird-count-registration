# Area Leader Guide - Christmas Bird Count Registration System
<!-- Created by Claude AI on 2025-10-10 -->

This guide covers using the area leader interface to view your team roster, access participant contact information, and review historical data.
## <h1 style="color: red;">CAUTION</h1>
<em style="color: red;">All original code and much of the documentation was generated by Claude.ai in response to prompts from Harvey Dueck.

Like every AI I've tried, Claude is prone to making exaggerated claims, stating that a test suite for a single feature
is "comprehensive", that some very sloppy code is "professional", or that something is "production ready" when it hasn't 
been tested yet.  Don't trust such value judgements in documentation
or code comments.  As of 10.10.2025 when I'm checking this in, I haven't yet had time to carefully review the documentation.
It's included in the hope that it will be useful, even if it's incomplete and occasionally inaccurate.

## What is an Area Leader?

Area leaders coordinate count activities within their assigned geographic area. Responsibilities typically include:

- **Pre-Count Coordination**: Contact team members to plan routes and meeting times
- **Team Communication**: Share logistics, safety information, and meeting locations
- **Day-of Leadership**: Lead or coordinate the count team in your area
- **Data Collection**: Ensure accurate bird counts and species identification
- **Post-Count Reporting**: Submit count data and coordinate with count compiler

**Note**: Area leaders are designated by count administrators and receive automated email notifications when team composition changes.

## Accessing the Leader Interface

### Login Process

1. Navigate to your count's registration URL and click "Leader Login" (or go directly to `/leader`)
2. Click "Sign in with Google"
3. Authenticate with your Google account
4. Your email must match a designated area leader in the system

**Access Requirements:**
- Google account (for authentication)
- Email address must match your leader assignment in the database
- Leaders without a google account can receive notifications but cannot access the web interface
  - You can create a google account for your non-google email address.  (For instructions, see [this google support page][https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/27441] and skip to where it says “Use an existing email address”)

### First-Time Login

After your first login:
- You'll see your assigned area and current team roster
- Team information updates automatically as participants register
- You can access historical data for your area (past 3 years)

## Dashboard Overview

The leader dashboard shows your complete team roster and lets you download a CSV file with all their contact information.  This CSV file is its main benefit over the emails you receive.

### Your Leader Information

Top of the page displays:
- **Your Name**: As recorded in the system
- **Area Assignment**: Which count area you're leading
- **Contact Information**: Your email and phone numbers
- **Year Selector**: Switch between current and historical years

### Team Summary

Quick statistics about your team:

### Year Tabs

- **Current Year Tab**: Default view, shows this year's team
